**Anomalophobia (n.)**

From the Greek 'anomalos' meaning irregular or abnormal, and 'phobia' meaning fear.

A psychological discomfort or aversion to objects, images, or situations that markedly deviate from what is typical, expected, or considered normal, especially when such deviations are extreme or exaggerated without a clear purpose or function.

**Characterized by an emotional response that may include feelings of unease, disgust, or anxiety**, particularly when confronted with altered representations of familiar objects that have been rendered dysfunctional, overly complex, or absurd. The reaction can be triggered by various stimuli, such as:

- Digital alterations,
- Surreal art,
- Physical objects that challenge conventional aesthetics, functionality, or the laws of physics.

This phobia may encompass, but is not limited to, responses similar to those observed in trypophobia, where clusters of objects or patterns evoke aversion. However, in anomalophobia, the trigger is the anomaly in the object's form or function rather than repetitive patterns.

**The intensity of the response can range from mild discomfort to severe aversion.** Note that it is not widely recognized in clinical settings.
