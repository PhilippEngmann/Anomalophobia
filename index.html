		<h1>Anomalophobia</h1>
		<aside>The fear of mutated or distorted objects</aside>
	</header>

	<h2>Formal Definition</h2>

	<h3>Anomalophobia (n.)</h3>

	<p>From the Greek 'anomalos' meaning irregular or abnormal, and 'phobia' meaning fear.</p>

	<p>A psychological discomfort or aversion to objects, images, or situations that markedly deviate from what is
		typical, expected, or considered normal, especially when such deviations are extreme or exaggerated without a
		clear purpose or function.</p>

	<p><strong>Characterized by an emotional response that may include feelings of unease, disgust, or anxiety</strong>,
		particularly when confronted with altered representations of familiar objects that have been rendered
		dysfunctional, overly complex, or absurd. The reaction can be triggered by various stimuli, such as digital
		alterations, or physical objects that challenge conventional aesthetics, functionality, or the laws of physics.
	</p>
	<p>This phobia may encompass, but is not limited to, responses similar to those observed in trypophobia, where
		clusters of objects or patterns evoke aversion. However, in anomalophobia, the trigger is the anomaly in the
		object's form or function rather than repetitive patterns. Other related internet phenomena include:

		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursed_image" target="_blank">Cursed Image</a>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>The intensity of the response can range from mild discomfort to severe aversion.</strong> Note that it is
		not widely recognized in clinical settings.</p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>The purpose of this site is to explore, discuss, and document this particular feeling that many of us have
		experienced, but weren't quite able to describe or articulate. Below are examples of images that may evoke
		anomalophobia in some individuals. The
		images are rated based on my personal perception of their potential to trigger anomalophobia. The PS3 controller
		in particular has been engrained in my memory since I was a kid, and I have seen it pop up in various places on
		the web and it gave me a sudden and very intense feeling of fear, disgust, and anxiety every time. It is the
		main inspiration for this site.</p>
	<p>Through the process of working on this site, I had to repeatedly confront this fear and I have become more
		comfortable with it.
		So if you're like me, you can just look at an image for long enough and your brain will eventually realize that
		you're not actually in any danger and the feeling should subside.</p>
	<p>There is a lot of potential for this topic to be explored further, and I would love to see more
		people share their experiences and thoughts on anomalophobia. If you have any images, thoughts, or stories you
		would like
		to
		share, please feel free to reach out to me at philippengmann02@gmail.com as I'm curious if this resonates with
		anyone. I would also appreciate any feedback or suggestions you
		may have for this site.</p>
	<!-- <p>This site is also part of a GitHub repository.</p> 
	<p>I have also created a survey to gather more quantitative data about anomalophobia.</p> -->
