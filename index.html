	<p><strong>Anomalophobia (n.)</strong></p>
	<p>From the Greek 'anomalos' meaning irregular or abnormal, and 'phobia' meaning fear.</p>
	<p>A psychological discomfort or aversion to objects, images, or situations that markedly deviate from what is
		typical, expected, or considered normal, especially when such deviations are extreme or exaggerated without a
		clear purpose or function.</p>
	<p><strong>Characterized by an emotional response that may include feelings of unease, disgust, or anxiety</strong>,
		particularly when confronted with altered representations of familiar objects that have been rendered
		dysfunctional, overly complex, or absurd. The reaction can be triggered by various stimuli, such as:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Digital alterations,</li>
		<li>Surreal art,</li>
		<li>Physical objects that challenge conventional aesthetics, functionality, or the laws of physics.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This phobia may encompass, but is not limited to, responses similar to those observed in trypophobia, where
		clusters of objects or patterns evoke aversion. However, in anomalophobia, the trigger is the anomaly in the
		object's form or function rather than repetitive patterns.</p>
	<p><strong>The intensity of the response can range from mild discomfort to severe aversion.</strong>Â The phobia may
		be experienced in isolation or as part of a broader spectrum of sensory sensitivities or aesthetic preferences.
		Note that it is not widely recognized in clinical settings. <!--  but is increasingly observed in psychological observations on
		aesthetic perception and sensory processing. (Don't like this last sentence, the &quot;no bullshit version&quot;
		is that I saw people online also finding these kinds of images unsettling, see AI tv-remote)</p> -->
